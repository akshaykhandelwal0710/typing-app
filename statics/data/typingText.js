    "Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.",
    "Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering. Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Certain robots require user input to operate while other robots function autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.",
    "Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics. Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.",
    "Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy are attracted to one another. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the tides of the oceans. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing and forming stars and caused the stars to group together into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.",
